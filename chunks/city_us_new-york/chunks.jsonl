My daughter wanted to see/experience NY life and attractions, so that's what we did. Used the Big Bus Tour, red & blue lines, and it was a solid way to see sights and then navigate back to where you wanted to explore. Had a great dinner at Pasta House. Make reservations. And spent most of the day at the Met. Well worth the experience. The addition of Uber/Lyft/et al has made getting around much easier. My biggest surprise was how mind-boggling expensive everything has become. Wow! However much you're saving for your trip, save more. Still, it is worth the trip and the experience. If this will be your only visit, go all in and enjoy everything.Show moreGuest review byMichaelUnited States - Review score8.0It's a great City with lots to see and do, transport is...It's a great City with lots to see and do, transport is great use the Metro where you can or simply walk", "metadata": {"heading": "## What Guests Said About New York:", "heading_level": 2, "heading_path": "Search hotels in New York, NY > What Guests Said About New York:", "path_elements": ["Search hotels in New York, NY", "What Guests Said About New York:"], "parent_headers": [{"text": "Search hotels in New York, NY", "level": 1, "markdown": "# Search hotels in New York, NY"}], "domain": "www.booking.com", "position": 1, "word_count": 200, "char_count": 1204, "nested_level": 1, "is_continuation": true}, "source_url": "https://www.booking.com/city/us/new-york.html", "created_at": "2025-06-16T02:59:24.606220", "chunk_type": "content_chunk"}
