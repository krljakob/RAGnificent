GOALS The goals of the shared translation task are: To investigate the applicability of current MT techniques when translating into languages other than English To examine special challenges in translating between European languages, including word order differences and morphology To investigate the translation of low-resource, morphologically rich languages To create publicly available corpora for machine translation and machine translation evaluation To generate up-to-date performance numbers in order to provide a basis of comparison in future research To offer newcomers a smooth start with hands-on experience in state-of-the-art statistical machine translation methods To investigate the usefulness of multilingual and third language resources To compare unsupervised MT in a controlled environment To assess the effectiveness of document-level approaches We hope that both beginners and established research groups will", "metadata": {"heading": "## Shared Task: Machine Translation of News", "heading_level": 2, "heading_path": "Translation Task - ACL 2019 fourth Conference on Machine Translation > Shared Task: Machine Translation of News", "path_elements": ["Translation Task - ACL 2019 fourth Conference on Machine Translation", "Shared Task: Machine Translation of News"], "parent_headers": [{"text": "Translation Task - ACL 2019 fourth Conference on Machine Translation", "level": 1, "markdown": "# Translation Task - ACL 2019 fourth Conference on Machine Translation"}], "domain": "www.statmt.org", "position": 0, "word_count": 200, "char_count": 1506, "nested_level": 1, "is_continuation": false}, "source_url": "https://www.statmt.org/wmt19/translation-task.html", "created_at": "2025-06-16T02:59:10.371103", "chunk_type": "content_chunk"}

The task is to improve current methods. We encourage a broad participation -- if you feel that your method is interesting but not state-of-the-art, then please participate in order to disseminate it and measure progress.

The translation quality is measured by a manual evaluation and various automatic evaluation metrics. Participants agree to contribute to the manual evaluation about eight hours of work, per system submission. You may participate in any or all of the eight language pairs. For all language pairs we will test translation in both directions. To have a common framework that allows for comparable results, and also to lower the barrier to entry, we provide a common training set, and a pre-processed version (TBC). You are not limited to this training set, and you are not limited to the training set provided for your target language pair. This means that multilingual systems are allowed, and classed as constrained as long as they use only data released for WMT19 (or older WMT Hindi-English and Turkish-English corpora, as listed below). If you use additional training data (not provided by the WMT19 organisers) or existing translation systems, you must flag that your system uses additional data. We will distinguish system submissions that used the provided training data (constrained) from submissions that used significant additional data resources.

Note that basic linguistic tools such as taggers, parsers, or morphological analyzers are allowed in the constrained condition. Your submission report should highlight in which ways your own methods and data differ from the standard task. You should make it clear which tools you used, and which training sets you used. The following two aspects of the task are new for 2019: Unsupervised learning and Document-level MT. Unsupervised learning For 2019, we also have an unsupervised subtrack: German to Czech translations, using monolingual German and Czech training data only, as well as last years' parallel dev and test sets for bootstrapping. The training data should come from the the constrained monolingual sets of WMT news translation data. No German-Czech parallel data is provided, and the participants cannot use any monolingual or parallel data for other languages and language pairs (thus zero-shot, transfer-learning and pivoting-based systems will be treated as part of the general news translation track).

Document-level MT In 2019, we are particularly interested in approaches which consider the whole document. We invite submissions of such approaches for English to German and Czech, and for Chinese to English. We will perform document-level human evaluation for these pairs. For English to German, we will be releasing as much of the training data as possible with document boundaries intact. For English to Czech, CzEng 1.7 (unchanged from last year) does already offer cross-sentential context for most of its \"domains\". No complete documents are available but all sentences in a \"block\" (i.e. those with the same \"-bNUM-\" number in the ID, e.g. subtitlesM-b15-00train-f000001-s*) formed a consecutive sequence in the original text. Sometimes the block is very short (just 1 sentence), and it is always limited to 13 or 15 sentences. No context information is available for the domains \"techdoc\", \"navajo\" and \"tweets\". The best context-aware domains are \"news\", \"eu\", \"subtitles*\" (well, subtitles) and \"fiction\".

We encourage a broad participation -- if you feel that your method is interesting but not state-of-the-art, then please participate in order to disseminate it and measure progress. Participants will use their systems to translate a test set of unseen sentences in the source language. The translation quality is measured by a manual evaluation and various automatic evaluation metrics. Participants agree to contribute to the manual evaluation about eight hours of work, per system submission. You may participate in any or all of the eight language pairs. For all language pairs we will test translation in both directions. To have a common framework that allows for comparable results, and also to lower the barrier to entry, we provide a common training set, and a pre-processed version (TBC).
