So I am a current PhD student in Machine Learning, working towards theoretical aspects of Reinforcement Learning. Additionally, I have interned at Google Deepmind and Adobe Research working towards applied aspects of AI, and here's what I had observed Academia: We don't really have access to a lot of compute (in comparison to industry) and given my works are towards theoretical aspects, we prove things mathematicaly and then move with the experiments, having known the possible outcome. While this is a lengthy process, it indeed gives that \"Research Vibe\" Industry: Here given we have a lot of compute, the work is like, you get an idea, you expect a few things intuitively, if it works great, else analyse the results, see what could have gone wrong and come up with a better approach. While I understand things are very applied here, I really don't get that \"Research Vibe\" and it seems more like a \"Product Dev\" Role. Though I am aware that even at these orgs there are teams working", "metadata": {"heading": "## [D] Monthly Who's Hiring and Who wants to be Hired?", "heading_level": 2, "heading_path": "Reddit - The heart of the internet > [D] Monthly Who's Hiring and Who wants to be Hired?", "path_elements": ["Reddit - The heart of the internet", "[D] Monthly Who's Hiring and Who wants to be Hired?"], "parent_headers": [{"text": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "level": 1, "markdown": "# Reddit - The heart of the internet"}], "domain": "www.reddit.com", "position": 0, "word_count": 200, "char_count": 1520, "nested_level": 1, "is_continuation": false}, "source_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/", "created_at": "2025-06-16T02:59:32.555930", "chunk_type": "content_chunk"}

While I understand things are very applied here, I really don't get that \"Research Vibe\" and it seems more like a \"Product Dev\" Role. Though I am aware that even at these orgs there are teams working on foundational aspects, but it seems to be very rare. So I genuinely wanted to get an idea from relevant experts, both from the industry and academia, on what I am really missing. Would appreciate any inputs on it, as I have always thought of joining industry after my PhD, but that vibe seems to be missing. ![u/microsoft365 avatar](https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2f8j4g/styles/profileIcon_mn0yocv9kc3f1.png?width=48&height=48&frame=1&auto=webp&crop=&s=ebcad6e9f94c68cf1125f0cfde28e246645863c9) ![](https://external-preview.redd.it/eeZL9-52qqqvnPExVCMJGNDEOBEe_HwDIcDJKJ8jIus.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=457c00d337af8141c9fc22abe7d40d3accd5b969) ![Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat helps you nail the meeting prep by analyzing, summarizing and drafting reports, so you can shine anywhere, anytime.](https://external-preview.redd.it/eeZL9-52qqqvnPExVCMJGNDEOBEe_HwDIcDJKJ8jIus.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=457c00d337af8141c9fc22abe7d40d3accd5b969) ![u/avd4292 avatar](https://www.redditstatic.com/avatars/defaults/v2/avatar_default_0.png) Hi, we have released a new paper that studies the underlying mechanism of artifacts in attention and feature maps from Vision Transformers Need Registers, a phenomena that has also been observed in LLMs (e.g., 1, 2). We propose a training-free method to mitigate this. As one of the authors, I am creating this post to kickstart any discussion.
